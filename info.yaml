  title:        "Wolf sheep cabbage river crossing puzzle ASIC design (🐺🐐🥬🚣)"
  description:  "Play the wolf, goat and cabbage puzzle interactively."
  how_it_works: "Truth table with the game logic (hidden easter egg). The inputs are the positions of the farmer, wolf, goat and cabbage. The 7-segment display shows the status of the game (won or lost)."
  how_to_test:  "Slide the input switches, think, have a look at the 7-segment display."
  external_hw:  "Input switches and 7-segment display"
  doc_link:     "https://github.com/maehw/wokwi-verilog-gds-wolf-goat-cabbage/blob/main/README.md"
  clock_hz:     0

  inputs:
    - not connected because it is typically used for clocked designs and may be used in the future of this design
    - input signal F for the position of the farmer (🧑‍🌾/🚣)
    - input signal W for the position of the wolf (🐺)
    - input signal G for the position of the goat (🐐)
    - input signal C for the position of the cabbage (🥬)
    - here be dragons or an easter egg
    - unused
    - unused
  outputs:
    - output signal ~E, i.e. the top and bottom segments light up, when the game is over ❌❌❌ due to an unattended situation on any river bank side
    - output signal ~R i.e. the top-right and bottom-right segments light up, to indicate an unattended situation on the right river bank (game over ❌)
    - output signal ~R i.e. the top-right and bottom-right segments light up, to indicate an unattended situation on the right river bank (game over ❌)
    - output signal ~E, i.e. the top and bottom segments light up, when the game is over ❌❌❌ due to an unattended situation on any river bank side
    - output signal ~L i.e. the top-left and bottom-left segments light up, to indicate an unattended situation on the left river bank (game over ❌)
    - output signal ~L i.e. the top-left and bottom-left segments light up, to indicate an unattended situation on the left river bank (game over ❌)
    - here be dragons or an easter egg
    - output signal A to light up the "dot LED" of the 7 segment display as an indicator that all objects have reached the right bank of the river and the game is won! 🎉🎉🎉
